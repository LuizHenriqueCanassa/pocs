# Simple Servlet

---

A simple application using servlet.

### How to execute

This application does not use the embedded server, we need to deploy it to a local server (Tomcat, Glassfish etc.).

To do this, just download a server that supports the java version 11+ and perform the deployment in the default folder for deployment depending on the chosen server.

### Used libraries

- Lombok
- Servlet Api
- JSTL
